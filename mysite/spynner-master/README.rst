Spynner is a stateful programmatic web browser module for Python.
It is based upon `PyQT <http://www.qtsoftware.com/>`_ and `WebKit <http://webkit.org/>`_.
It supports Javascript, AJAX, and every other technology that !WebKit is able to handle (Flash, SVG, ...).
Spynner takes advantage of `JQuery <http://jquery.com>`_. a powerful Javascript library that makes the interaction with pages and event simulation really easy.

Using Spynner you would able to simulate a web browser with no GUI (though a browsing window can be opened for debugging purposes), so it may be used to implement crawlers or acceptance testing tools.

Running Spynner without X11
====================================
- Spynner needs a X11 server to run. If you are running it in a server without X11.
  You must install the virtual `Xvfb server <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb>`_.
  Debian users can use the small wrapper (xvfb-run). If you are not using Debian, you can download it here:
  http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-x@lists.debian.org/msg69632/x-run ::

    xvfb-run python myscript_using_spynner.py

- You can also use tightvnc, which is the solution of the actual maintainer [kiorky].
